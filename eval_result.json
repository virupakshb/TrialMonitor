The comprehensive search of medical history found no evidence of: (1) CNS metastases of any type (brain, leptomeningeal, spinal cord), (2) neurological symptoms suggestive of CNS involvement, or (3) medications typically used to manage CNS metastases (corticosteroids for symptom control or anti-epileptics). While the subject has progressive NSCLC with new lesions as of December 2024, there is no evidence these new lesions involve the central nervous system. The absence of supportive care medications (steroids, anti-seizure drugs) further supports that any CNS involvement is unlikely.","confidence":"high","evaluation_method":"llm_with_tools","tools_used":["check_medical_history","check_conmeds","get_tumor_assessments","check_medical_history"],"action_required":"None - subject remains eligible","recommendation":"Subject 101-001 does not meet exclusion criterion EXCL-002.
