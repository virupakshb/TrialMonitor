All events occurred post-randomization (treatment started 2024-08-15) and were assessed as related to study drug. The myocarditis and pneumonitis are particularly serious irAESI that definitively meet the exclusion criterion. While the subject had pre-existing subclinical hypothyroidism, the new immune-related thyroiditis represents a distinct condition with opposite pathophysiology (hyperthyroidism vs hypothyroidism).
