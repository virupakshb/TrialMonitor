The tumor assessment on 2025-01-09 clearly documents Progressive Disease with a new hepatic lesion, meeting RECIST 1.1 criteria for progression (appearance of one or more new lesions). This represents the primary endpoint event (PFS) occurring during the post-randomization phase. The subject had initially shown Partial Response on 2024-10-17 but progressed by 2025-01-09, establishing a clear PFS event date."

      "reasoning": "The exclusion criterion EP-005 requires EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire completion at required study timepoints (Baseline, Week 9, Week 18, Week 24 End of Treatment, Follow-up). The visit records clearly document that the QoL questionnaire was NOT completed at Week 9 and Week 18 visits. The Week 24 EOT visit was missed entirely, and the Follow-up visit could not occur due to subject's death. While the baseline visit notes indicate 'All baseline assessments completed,' there's no specific documentation of QoL questionnaire completion. Given this is a post-randomization phase evaluation, the missed QoL assessments represent protocol deviations rather than screening failures. However, the criterion specifically states questionnaire completion is required at these timepoints, and the documented failures to complete at multiple required visits mean the subject meets this exclusion criterion."
